# Word-Sprint-Timer
A basic word sprint timer to check your words per minute after completing it!

# Features
- Customizable timer sound choice!
- Color-changing circle!
- Previous final word count automatically applied to next sprint!

# Limitations
- Not very pretty, but functional.
- Manual inputs for word count results.

# Why make this?
I wanted a tool to measure my words per minute after a writing sprint. Some tools do this, but they generally needed an account or were a timer with no word-count calculations. Figured if I couldn't find any, I'd make my own! It's not very pretty but it is functional, and I'm not very good at front-end stuff.

# Extra
You can rename any .wav file to default.wav to let the program simply use it by default on startup. Otherwise you will have to change it each time. Enjoy!
